1. Matrix effect Sequence - 23 Math for Game Developers - Prop Positioning (TRS Matrices)

number 1:Scaling
number 2:Rotation
number 3:Translation
But take it to equation, it become: Translation * Rotation * Scaling * V

Because the one nearest to the v will first make effect.


2. inverse matrix - 24 Updated Bullet Collisions (Coordinate Systems)  
Inverse matrx can do the revert operation of a matrix
make intersection between no-algin AABB and a line, you can transform line to the local coordinate system of AABB
